This is from the html/css section of The Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

My first attempt at replicating the look of arguably the most popular webpage. 

This assignment has allowed me to practice:
- creating a github repository and using git to manage the files
- build navigation bars and formatting them in various positions using CSS
- centering elements such as images, text-input fields and buttons using CSS
